# Kaleidos

Kaleidos is the mortal world where **Earth, Wind & Mire** takes place: a land living through the **Feyrule Interregnum**, a century after the gods went silent.

## At a glance

- **The gods went silent** about 100 years ago.
- **The Long Winter** followed—an endless, brutal winter that nearly ended mortal life.
- The Long Winter ended only after a bargain with the **Feywild**, trading **temporary stewardship** of Kaleidos to the fey until the gods returned.
- The gods still have not returned.

## The current era: Feyrule Interregnum

The fey govern what mortals once expected the divine to govern: death, harvests, sea, sun, dreams, fate, and stranger portfolios besides. They perform these duties in their own way—beautiful, alien, and often dangerous.

Each year, the fey influence grows stronger. Edges blur. Reality becomes more flexible.
