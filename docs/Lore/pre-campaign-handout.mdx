# Pre-Campaign Handout (Session 0)

This page captures the campaign premise and player-facing expectations for **Earth, Wind & Mire**.

## The world you know

A hundred years ago, in the mortal world of **Kaleidos**, the gods went silent.

It started small: prayers unanswered, ships lost at sea, harvests failing despite every ritual performed correctly. The clergy made excuses. The faithful kept faith.

Then came winter—an endless, brutal winter. By the twelfth year, the sun rose and set in the span of a minute: a sliver of gold on the horizon, then gone.

The kingdoms, clans, and old houses set aside old grievances and formed a coalition. Divine intervention was no longer an option. Some houses proposed seeking help from the Hells. The proposals were rejected—unanimously, publicly, firmly.

Instead, the coalition turned to the Feywild and bargained for an end to the Long Winter, offering temporary stewardship of the world until the gods returned.

## The world you live in

The Long Winter ended. Seasons returned—but not the seasons that were.

The fey brought **three** seasons of their own making and abandoned winter entirely. The duties of the gods were divided among the courts: death, harvests, the sea, the sun, dreams, fate, and more.

Every year, the fey influence grows stronger. The edges of things blur. Reality becomes more flexible.

> Expect the unexpected in the Feyrule Interregnum of Kaleidos.

The fey hold power in trust, *until the gods return*. But a hundred years have passed. And the gods have not returned.

## Tone & expectations

- This campaign will be **beautiful**: wonder, strangeness, and moments that take your breath away.
- This campaign will be **funny**: the fey have a sense of humor; so do we.
- This campaign will get **weird**: surreal, dreamlike, occasionally unsettling.
- This campaign will have **real stakes**: people can be lost, changed, or forgotten.
- This campaign will ask **hard questions**: sacrifice, acceptance, and whether a beautiful lie beats a harsh truth.
