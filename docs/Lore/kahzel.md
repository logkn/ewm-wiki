# Kahzel

Kahzel is a bustling, moderately sized city seated at the base of the [Harkwall Mountains](harkwall-mountains.md). Extensive metal veins in the range drew dwarven miners roughly 50 years before the [Long Winter](long-winter.md), and the city grew into a cosmopolitan hub with heavy dwarven influence.

Kahzel’s craftspeople and metalworkers became known for experimentation and innovation—producing both remarkable advances and a steady stream of failed constructs and metal byproduct.
