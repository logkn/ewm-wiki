# The Feyrule Interregnum

The Feyrule Interregnum is the current age of Kaleidos: the time between the gods’ silence and their eventual return—an “interregnum” held in trust by the fey courts.

## At a glance

- It began when the **Long Winter** ended through a bargain with the **Feywild**.
- The fey rule as **stewards** (or **occupiers**, depending on who you ask).
- The world now turns on **three fey seasons**, not four mortal ones.
- The longer the interregnum lasts, the more the world becomes **fey-touched**.

## What changed

The fey took on duties mortals once attributed to the gods: death, harvests, sea, sun, dreams, fate, and more. These duties are still performed, but not always in ways mortals find comforting—or predictable.

Winter was abandoned entirely.

## The questions that divide

The interregnum is not morally settled. People disagree on what Kaleidos is becoming, and what should be done about it.

- **Occupation:** The fey wear an illusory mask of benevolence. Their gifts are cages; every favor carries strings. These people want to find the gods and restore the old world—winter and all.
- **Liberation:** The gods abandoned their posts. The fey saved the world when the divine would not. Strange is not the same as bad, and many lives are better now.
- **Survival:** Philosophy is a luxury. Learn the real rules (salt, iron, spoken thanks). Avoid attention. Don’t bargain unless you understand the terms.
- **Service:** There is power in collaboration. The courts need mortal agents, and the interregnum rewards those who become useful—at a price.
- **Other arrangements:** If fey rule is the problem, some look for forces strong enough to contest it. The Hells are one obvious option, with terms that are practical if brutal.
