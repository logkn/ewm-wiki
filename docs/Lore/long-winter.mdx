# The Long Winter

The Long Winter was the defining catastrophe of the last century in **Kaleidos**: an era when the gods went silent and winter became endless.

## What happened

- **The gods went silent.** Prayers stopped being answered. Rituals failed. The sea grew hungry. Harvests withered despite correct observance.
- **Winter came and did not leave.** Cold crept into everything, and each day brought longer darkness.
- **By the twelfth year, the sun barely rose.** Those who lived through it still remember the final “sunrise”: a minute-long sliver of gold at the horizon, then night again.

## The Coalition

As the world began to fail, old rivalries were set aside. Kingdoms, clans, and houses formed an unprecedented coalition to seek salvation before everyone froze, starved, or disappeared into the dark.

Divine intervention was no longer an option.

## The Bargain With the Fey

Some houses argued for calling on the Hells—devils still answered when summoned—but the proposal was rejected, unanimously and publicly.

Instead, the coalition turned to the **Feywild**. An expedition crossed the veil to bargain with the fey courts: end the Long Winter, and take temporary stewardship of the world until the gods returned.

The fey agreed—on their own terms.

## Aftermath

The Long Winter ended, and seasons returned—but not the ones mortals remembered. In the fey’s stewardship, **three** seasons rule the year, each governed by a court.
