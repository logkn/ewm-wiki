# Zera Springtoe

Played by: REDACTED

## Overview

Zera Springtoe is a halfling artificer (~140) from a family farm and junk yard outside [Kahzel](../Lore/kahzel.md). Intensely driven and brutally blunt, she treats tinkering as the answer to nearly any problem—no matter the personal cost.

Zera is a follower of [Abbathor](../Lore/abbathor.md), whom she frames less as the “god of greed” and more as the god of _burning desire_—the kind of selfish, focused wanting that (to her) drives progress.

## Faith — Abbathor

In common speech Abbathor is “the god of greed,” but Zera prefers a closer translation from old Dwarvish: the god of burning desire—an intense, selfish wanting that can be harnessed to build, invent, and endure.

Common beliefs Zera holds (and attributes to Abbathor’s faithful):

- Greed is not inherently evil; intense desire can drive progress and can even serve as an impulse toward good.
- Survival itself is greedy: to want, to keep, to endure. Denying that is naive.
- Greed can be isolating; pursuing a grand end goal (fortune, power, knowledge) often costs intimacy. That price may be necessary.
- Abbathor’s banishment is often blamed on other deities’ distrust of his motives more than a single, provable crime (details vary by teller).

## Early Life

Zera grew up at the Springtoe family farm and junk yard—about three miles outside [Kahzel](../Lore/kahzel.md). The property spans over 100 acres of pasture and (before the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md)) supported more than 300 sheep. About three acres were given over to scrap and failed constructs, fed by a growing city that produced more crafting byproduct than its infrastructure could handle.

Zera’s parents:

- [Shawna Springtoe](../NPCs/shawna-springtoe.md) — a talented craftswoman who sold yarn, tapestries, and fine woolen clothing.
- [Farland Springtoe](../NPCs/farland-springtoe.md) — a miner who began the junk yard as a side business, hauling scrap home from Kahzel.

As a child, Zera went into town each morning with her father and her closest friend, [Jarlox Gweden](../NPCs/jarlox-gweden.md). Farland dropped them at school, worked the mines, then collected them for the ride home—often with scrap metal loaded in the cart.

As Zera got older, she took over the “junk runs,” planning routes, building stronger carts with more capacity, and eventually selling constructs of her own design made from salvaged parts.

## Tri-Hilt Guild

Zera was welcomed into the [Tri-Hilt Guild](../Organizations/tri-hilt-guild.md), an elite craftsmen’s guild with roots in Kahzel and a reputation for intricate mechanical invention and construct-building. Many members are devotees of Abbathor.

Zera’s long-time mentor was [Monroe Hammerfist](../NPCs/monroe-hammerfist.md), the guild’s head: a dwarf of roughly 250 years with salt-and-pepper hair and beard (heavy on the salt), piercing blue eyes, and a booming laugh he reserves for those he trusts.

Before the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md), the guild numbered 200+ members spread across the continent. In the century since, fewer than five senior members remain in Kahzel, and a true convening of the guild has not occurred in over 100 years.

## The Long Winter

When the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md) came, Zera and her family did not flee to the city. Instead they used decades of accumulated scrap to build a self-sufficient compound on the farm. Life was harsh, but the city still needed somewhere to put its waste—even as the junk runs grew fewer and fewer.

As years ground on, Zera’s parents grew old and frail and eventually passed. Zera withdrew further, becoming a true recluse and leaving her compound only a handful of times to see Jarlox and Monroe.

## Hank and Snip

Eventually, loneliness pushed Zera to create companions—constructs that were both practical and personal.

### Snip (homunculus servant)

“Snip” is a pair of old-fashioned shearing scissors that hang at Zera’s belt until commanded to fly. A small emerald is set into the base of the handle; when airborne, the blades oscillate like slow wings.

### Hank (steel defender)

“Hank” is a medium-sized robotic ram: strong but slender, wrapped in thick layers of steel wool and metal shavings with green emerald eyes. The frame weighs roughly 75 lbs.

- Wool can be pushed back to reveal a small metal saddle engraved **Hank da Tank** on the pommel.
- Large curled horns serve as both weapon and convenient quarterstaff storage (and can double as handlebars).
- A slot in the top of Hank’s head can accept a sickle buried into the frame, emerging above the skull (possible add-on mechanic: _TBD with DM_).

Sheep—seasonal breeders—did not survive the Long Winter. Heartbroken by the loss of her family’s flock, Zera built Hank as a woolly companion that reminded her of simpler times. For the last 50 years he has served as protection and transport, and Zera treats him as a friend—not merely a construct.

## Now

Zera is trying to find her place in a society still scarred by a century of loss. She expected the end of the Long Winter to bring a resurgence of prosperity and progress, but instead sees people stuck in struggle—surviving in a world of constant change that, to her eye, lacks purpose.

## Personality

- Intensely driven: tinkering is how she fixes problems and pursues progress.
- Self-sufficient: she does not believe she needs support.
- Blunt: “Why sugar coat shit? Ain’t gonna make it easier to swallow.”

## Flaws

- Blinded by end goals: she overlooks collateral damage and second-order consequences until it’s too late.

## Goals

- Raise [Abbathor](../Lore/abbathor.md) to greater power in the mortal plane through renewed divine worship.
- Not inherently anti-fey, but she rejects the idea that the fey are arbiters of progress; she sees them as passive in the face of suffering.
- Reconvening the [Tri-Hilt Guild](../Organizations/tri-hilt-guild.md) matters to her, though it is not strictly required for her cause.
