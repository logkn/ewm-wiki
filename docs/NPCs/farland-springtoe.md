# Farland Springtoe

Farland Springtoe is [Zera Springtoe](../PCs/zera-springtoe.md)’s father: a miner around [Kahzel](../Lore/kahzel.md) who started the family junk yard as a side business. He hauled scrap metal back from town, and townsfolk often paid him to take it; for larger failed constructs, clients typically arranged their own deliveries.
