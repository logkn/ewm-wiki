# Jarlox Gweden

Jarlox Gweden is [Zera Springtoe](../PCs/zera-springtoe.md)’s close childhood friend from the outskirts of [Kahzel](../Lore/kahzel.md). Congenital defects in his legs severely limited his mobility; despite advanced medical efforts he never achieved full function.

As children, Jarlox and Zera built makeshift carriages from junk-yard refuse—pulled by sheep trained by Zera. Under [Monroe Hammerfist](monroe-hammerfist.md)’s mentorship, the pair later constructed a highly mobile wheelchair suited for stairs and rough city terrain (but not the wilderness).

With the onset of the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md), Jarlox settled in Kahzel while Zera withdrew to the farm compound.
