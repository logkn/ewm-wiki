# Shawna Springtoe

Shawna Springtoe is [Zera Springtoe](../PCs/zera-springtoe.md)’s mother: a talented craftswoman who sold yarn, tapestries, and fine woolen clothing. Early in the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md) her work was lucrative, but as the flock dwindled the family relied increasingly on Zera’s junk-yard tinkering to make a living.
