# Tri-Hilt Guild

The Tri-Hilt Guild is an elite craftsmen’s guild known for intricate mechanical invention and construct-building. Founded in [Kahzel](../Lore/kahzel.md), its membership once spread across the continent among those “in the know” (not quite a secret society, but not typically advertised).

Many guild members are devotees of [Abbathor](../Lore/abbathor.md), and guild doctrine tends to frame innovation as an expression of driven desire: want something badly enough, and build the world that makes it possible.

## Notes

- Before the [Long Winter](../Lore/long-winter.md), the guild counted 200+ members.
- Fewer than five senior members are said to remain in Kahzel, and a full convening has not occurred in over 100 years.
- [Monroe Hammerfist](../NPCs/monroe-hammerfist.md) is remembered as the long-time head of the guild.
